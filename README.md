Code in support of this post: [Anomaly Detection: Predicting Credit Card Fraud](https://dailydatablog.wordpress.com/2017/10/05/blog-post-title-2/)


This repository provides the jupyter notebook used to analyze and model data from the Kaggle [](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud) dataset. All packages required come built in with anaconda so once you have that installed it should be fine. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/data).
